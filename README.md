# Data-Mining-and-Machine-Learning-SS23
All homeworks from the lecture DMML in SS23.
This repository contains my own solutions for the various Data Mining and Machine Learning assignments during the sommer semester 2023.
The assignments give a great overview about several supervised and unsupervised ML, going from k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN), normal regression/classification algorithms like Linear/logistic regression and Decision Trees (DTs) to Deep Learning models.
